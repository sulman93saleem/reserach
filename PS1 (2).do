/* "In order to determine the happiest states in America, WalletHub compared the
50 states across three key dimensions: 1) Emotional & Physical Well-Being, 2) 
Work Environment and 3) Community & Environment. We evaluated those dimensions 
using 31 relevant metrics, which are listed below with their corresponding 
weights. Each metric was graded on a 100-point scale, with a score of 100 
representing maximum happiness. Finally, we determined each stateâ€™s weighted 
average across all metrics to calculate its overall score and used the resulting
 scores to rank-order our sample."

 max of 66.
